# START HERE — IFS PARTS MAPPER (V1)

If you are a human developer or an AI coding assistant: start with THIS file.

This project is a mapping tool, not a therapy tool.

---

## What this app is

- non-clinical
- phenomenological
- representational
- non-interpretive
- privacy-first
- user-owned

The system records what the user chooses to represent.
It must never interpret meaning.

---

## Canonical Governance (Read First)

1) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_V1_Supreme_Authority.md

This document defines the final authority order for V1 specs.

2) spec/SPEC_AUTHORITY_MAP.md

This document restates the authority order in a quick, machine-friendly way.

If anything conflicts, the Supreme Authority hierarchy wins.

---

## Canonical Authority Order (V1)

Follow this order exactly:

1) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_v1_Errata.md  
2) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_V1_Clarifications_Patch.md  
3) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_Minimal_Canonical_JSON_Schema_V1.md  
4) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_V1_Model_Contract.md  
5) spec/IFS_Parts_Mapper_Master_Spec_Hardened.md  
6) Everything else is guidance only (wireframes, build maps, mapping tables, notes)

---

## Non-Canonical / Archive Warning

DO NOT use the following file as authority:

- spec/IFS_PARTS_MAPPER_MASTER_SPEC.md

It is retained for historical/reference purposes only and may conflict with canonical V1 specs.

---

## Non-Drift Rules (Hard Boundary)

Do NOT implement features that:

- interpret Parts or relationships
- infer psychological meaning
- provide therapy guidance or analysis
- auto-classify Parts or relationships
- generate insights/summaries about what a map “means”
- apply AI/ML to interpret maps

If a feature answers “What does this mean?”, it is out of scope.

---

## Working Rule

Before coding: cite the exact canonical spec section(s) you are implementing.
If you cannot cite them, do not code.
